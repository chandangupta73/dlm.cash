- Tracks total referrals and earnings by currency
- Links to referrer (who referred this user)
- Automatic stats updates
- One-to-one relationship with User model

C. Referral Model
- Multi-level referral tracking
- Level-based relationships (1 = direct, 2+ = indirect)
- Referrer chain tracking
- Unique constraints for data integrity
- Database indexes for performance

D. ReferralEarning Model
- Tracks all referral bonus payments
- Currency-specific amounts (INR/USDT)
- Status tracking (pending, credited, failed, cancelled)
- Links to investment that triggered the earning
- Percentage used for calculation

E. ReferralMilestone Model
- Configurable achievement milestones
- Two condition types: total_referrals, total_earnings
- Automatic bonus crediting
- Admin-managed activation
- Currency-specific bonus amounts
